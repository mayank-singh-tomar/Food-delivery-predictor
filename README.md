**Welcome to our Food Delivery Time Predictor Website!**

*What is this?*

This website predicts how long it will take for your food to arrive when you order online. It gives you an estimate so you can plan your day better!


*How does it work?*

We use clever algorithms and data from past deliveries to guess how long your food will take to get to you. We take into account things like distance, time of day, and how busy the restaurant is.


*How to use it?*

1. Enter your location and the restaurant you're ordering from.
2. We'll give you an estimated time for your delivery.
3. Sit back, relax, and wait for your delicious meal to arrive!

   
*Why should you trust us?*

We're constantly improving our predictions based on feedback and new data. While we can't guarantee the exact time, we do our best to give you a good estimate.
